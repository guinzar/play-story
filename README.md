# PlayStory

PlayStory is an app for keeping track of the important games you've played over your lifetime, recording the stories/moments you've experienced in them, and visualizing your comprehensive gaming history with cool timelines. PlayStory will also grow to have social features as well. Ultimately, the project can eventually be described sort of like a cross between Facebook/MyAnimeList but for video games.
